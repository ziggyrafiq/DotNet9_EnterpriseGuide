## Introduction
This repository highlights the powerful features of .NET 9 and C# 13, including:

- **Minimal APIs**: High-performance endpoints with minimal APIs.  
- **Real-time**: Blazor provides real-time enterprise dashboards.  
- **Security**: OAuth2 and JWT are advanced security protocols.  
- **Enhanced Diagnostics**: With .NET 9 tools, enhanced diagnostics and monitoring are possible.  
- **C# 13 Improvements**: Enhancements such as pattern matching and inline lambdas.  


## Projects Overview

### EnterpriseAPIs  
Create high-performance and secure APIs with minimal boilerplate by using .NET 9's minimal APIs.  
**Features:**  
- **JWT Authentication**.  
- Minimal API endpoints for CRUD operations.  
- AOT Compilation for enhanced performance.  

### BlazorRealTimeDashboard  
Using Blazor, create a dynamic real-time enterprise dashboard.  
**Features:**  
- Simulation of real-time data updates.  
- Blazor rendering in .NET 9 has been optimized.  
- An interactive user interface for enterprise metrics.  

### SecurityCompliance  
Use OAuth2 and FIDO2 for enterprise applications to implement modern security standards.  
**Features:**  
- Authentication with OAuth2 is supported.  
- Validation examples for secure tokens.  
- Compliance-ready configurations are demonstrated.  

### UnitTests  
A comprehensive NUnit test suite for validating .NET 9 features.  
**Features:**  
- Testing the API endpoints.  
- Validation of C# 13 enhancements such as list patterns and inline lambdas.  
- Mock tests simulating real-world scenarios.  

## Features Covered  

- **Performance Enhancements**: AOT compilation reduces memory usage and speeds up application startup.  
- **Cloud-Native Capabilities**: Integrate Kubernetes and develop microservices more efficiently.  
- **Advanced C# Features**: Pattern matching, inline lambdas, and `Span<T>` enhancements.  
- **Diagnostics and Monitoring**: Built-in tools like `dotnet trace` and `dotnet monitor`.  
- **Security**: Authentication through JWT and OAuth2 ensures robust and secure applications.  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites  
- Visual Studio 2022 (v17.7 or later).
